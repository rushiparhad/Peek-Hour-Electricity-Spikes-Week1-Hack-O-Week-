## 📌 Project Title
**Week 1 Project — Data Analysis & Forecasting Basics**

Notebook File:
- `hCKO_WEEK_PROJECT_week1.ipynb`

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Week 1 is the starting phase where the main objective is to understand:
- How to work with datasets using Python
- How to clean and preprocess data
- How to visualize trends and patterns
- How to prepare the data for forecasting/ML tasks

This project builds the base for future projects such as:
- **Week 2: Classroom Usage Forecasting**
- **Week 3: Library Energy During Exams Dashboard**

## 🎯 Why This Project?

This project is useful because it helps in:
✅ Understanding Python data science workflow  
✅ Learning preprocessing steps required before forecasting  
✅ Building confidence in handling real datasets  
✅ Creating meaningful charts and insights  
✅ Preparing for advanced dashboards and prediction models

## 🧠 Workflow / Methodology

### 1️⃣ Import Libraries
- Import required Python libraries for analysis and visualization.

### 2️⃣ Load Dataset
- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

### 3️⃣ Data Understanding
- Check dataset shape, columns, data types
- Identify missing values and invalid records
- Get summary statistics

### 4️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (drop/fill)
- Convert columns into correct data types
- Remove unwanted duplicates or noise
- Prepare dataset for analysis/forecasting

### 5️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify patterns and trends in data
- Analyze important relationships between variables
- Generate insights using charts and statistics

### 6️⃣ Visualization
- Plot trends using line charts / bar charts (depending on dataset)
- Highlight important observations

### 7️⃣ Basic Forecasting / Prediction (if included)
- Apply simple forecasting logic / model approach
- Compare actual vs predicted trends (if applicable)

### 8️⃣ Conclusion
- Summarize key findings and outcomes
